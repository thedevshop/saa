This apartment in Paris is very well located next to the 8th district and is only a few steps away from the Camps Elyses and the Arc de Triomphe. All the shops that you could need are very close, such as a supermarket, bakeries, and fish shop, as well as the high end shops on the most famous avenue in the world. You will particularly love the well known Poncelet market nearby, beloved by the inhabitants, where fresh fruit and vegetables are available and butchers offer their wares. Not to be missed is the fish shop Daguerre Mare, which is one of the best in Paris. Pierre Demours Street itself is very calm, the Lebon Street and its covered market (Le March Couvert de Ternes) are next door. The closest subway stops are Ternes, Argentine and Charles de Gaulle Etoile. Many bus lines also run through here.
